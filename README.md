Balls
=====

Super awesome service that allows you to rule the world over SMS.

Balls is devided into apps, features, and commands. For example Ebay would be an app, avgprice would be a feature, and skateboard would be a command.
More symply put, the syntax is "<app> <feature> <command>" seperated by spaces.
